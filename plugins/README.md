# Agent Skills

Distributable agent skills for .NET MAUI development. Installable via the Copilot CLI, Claude Code, or VS Code plugin system.

DevFlow runtime skills (`maui-devflow-onboard`, `maui-devflow-connect`, `maui-devflow-debug`) are bundled with the `maui` CLI from `.claude/skills/`, installed with `maui devflow init`, and also exposed through the plugin manifest.
